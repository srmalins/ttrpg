      <description>Styles Objects used for aquariums include: coffee tables, sinks, gumball machines and even toilets. Another such example is the MacQuarium, an aquarium made from the shell of an Apple Macintosh computer. In recent years, elaborate custom-designed home aquariums costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have become status symbolsâ€”according to The New York Times, &amp;ldquo;among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers.</description>

      <description>Materials Most aquaria consist of glass panes bonded together by 100% silicone sealant, with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about 1,000 litres (260 US gal; 220 imp gal). However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first. Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as cuboid, hexagonal, angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards).</description>

      <description>Soldier of the Blood Queen The Blood Queen is an ancient undead vampire Deity that is also a goddess of war and conquest. It is rumored that The Blood Queen still maintains a physical form on one of the dark and desolate outer-planes; still other rumors indicate that she long ago transcended physical representation at a fixed point in either time or space. Her will is expressed through her clerics, the most devout and trusted of which are called to be Soldiers; Lieutenants, Captains, Generals, and individual champions in battle her Soldiers are the direct expression of her will in the multiverse.</description>
