      <description>Soldier of the Blood Queen The Blood Queen is an ancient undead vampire Deity that is also a goddess of war and conquest. It is rumored that The Blood Queen still maintains a physical form on one of the dark and desolate outer-planes; still other rumors indicate that she long ago transcended physical representation at a fixed point in either time or space. Her will is expressed through her clerics, the most devout and trusted of which are called to be Soldiers; Lieutenants, Captains, Generals, and individual champions in battle her Soldiers are the direct expression of her will in the multiverse.</description>
