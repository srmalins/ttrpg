A *Table-Top Role-Playing Game* is a **game** in which: 

	1. The players assume the **role** of one or more characters in a
	fictional world; and
	2. The outcome of the choices of the players for their characters
	are adjudicated by a player using a system of rules which may
	involve random number generated by dice, cards, other analog
	methods, or digital processes simulating the former;
	
An example of a *Table-Top Role-Playing Game* is {{< remote

inspired it.
