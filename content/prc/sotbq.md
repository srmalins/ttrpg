**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** When a new soldier of The Blood Queen
levle is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells
known, if applicable) as if they had also gained a level in whatever
spellcasting class they belonged to before they added the prestige
class. They do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of
that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or
rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially
means that they add the level of soldier of The Blood Queen to the
level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then
determines spells per day and spells known accordingly. If a character
had more than on spellcasting class in which they could cast 1st-level
divine spells before they became a soldier of The Blood Queen, the

outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever the soldier's creature
type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally,
the soldier gains damage reduiction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders,
the soldeir can still be brought back from the dead as if they were a
member of their previous creature type. The character no longer takes
penalties to their ability scores for aging and cannot be magically
